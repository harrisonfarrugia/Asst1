Workload E:

Workload E tests mymalloc by saturating the memory array with a pointer the size of all available memory,
then repeatedly attempting to malloc 1 byte. The purpose of this workload is to test the error reporting
of mymalloc when too much memory is attempted to be allocated over and over. The desired output is an error
report for each failed malloc, and one error report for attempting to free the null pointer that cannot be allocated.

Workload F:

Workload F tests whether or not mymalloc merges free blocks that are not adjacent to one another, which is should not.
This workload creates an array, then mallocs 1 byte for each element. It then frees every other block, and attempts to
malloc for a size that is larger than any individual available block of memory. The desired output for this function is
repeated error reports for failed mallocs.
